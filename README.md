# Simple-Graph-Matching
# Graph Matching Tool

This notebook contains Python code that utilizes NetworkX to perform maximum matching in a graph and visualize the matching edges.
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python (>=3.x)
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/graph-matching-tool.git
    ```
2. Install required Python packages:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the `graph_matching_tool.py` file:
    ```
    python graph_matching_tool.py
    ```
2. Enter the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` when prompted.
3. Enter the pairs of vertices for each edge as prompted.
4. The tool will output the maximum matching found in the graph and display a visualization of the graph with matching edges highlighted in different colors.
